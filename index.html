            <p>I respond to many names but most frequently people call me Joe, I'm from 
                Simi Valley where currently reside and work for a utility company.  I was fortunate 
                enough to travel throughout Central America for three and a half months
                following university.  During which I caught a fervor 
                as well as the travel bug.  Since then, I priority traveling over
                everything else.  My goal is to obtain a job that allows me to 
                work ideally while I travel the world.  I have always been interested 
                in coding and have friends that recommended a bootcamp.  I 
                hope that the web development skills I will learn in this course 
                will lead to a change in my profession.</p>
